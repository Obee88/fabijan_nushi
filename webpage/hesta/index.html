      <div class="text">In the pursuit of creating a user-centric IoT product, we conducted a comprehensive three-day discovery phase that centered around user research. By engaging in forums, discussions, and conversations with users, as well as analyzing academic articles from the IoT industry, we were able to gain valuable insights into the expectations and needs of our target audience. Leveraging a combination of user research methods, we uncovered the nuanced details necessary to deliver a product that meets user expectations and addresses their specific requirements. Users emphasized three key points: frustration with device compatibility issues, difficulties in connecting multiple users and managing other devices, and the desire for more freedom in interface design to personalize the application according to individual needs rather than having a standard design for all users.</div>
