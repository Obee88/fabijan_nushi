      <span class="label">DEEP DIVE INTO RESEARCH INTERVIEW</span>
      <p class="text">Interviewing users and understanding their travel needs is a crucial aspect of user experience design. Through a series of user interviews, we aim to gain insights into how users explore travel destinations inspired by movies and series and what factors attract them to these destinations.<p>
      <p class="text">What patterns do users follow when planning trips to locations featured in movies or series? How do they incorporate their media-inspired travel ideas into their itinerary?</p>
      <p class="text">What are the key factors that influence users' decision to visit a travel destination inspired by movies or series? Is it primarily the portrayal of the location in the media, or do other factors such as affordability, accessibility, or personal interests also play a role?</p>
      <p class="text">In what ways do users learn something extra from the cultural aspect of these destinations? Have they gained insights or knowledge beyond what was portrayed in the media? How do these experiences contribute to their overall travel satisfaction and fulfillment?</p>
      <p class="text">How do users gather information about the cultural significance of these travel destinations? Do they rely on online resources, guidebooks, local recommendations, or a combination of these? What factors influence their decision-making process when it comes to selecting and planning trips inspired by movies or series?</p>
      <p class="text">We uncovered many user insights and pain points from studies that looked at how users plan their trips based on the movies and series they've watched and decide to travel to those destinations. The findings were valuable in shaping future user experience design decisions.</p>
